# Bachelor Thesis

Coded attached to My Bachelor Thesis.
This thesis examined the consequences of trying to synchronize physics simulations over the network.

Tis was done by first creating an application in Unreal Engine 4 where PhysX was used as a basis for physics simulation.
A protocol was then written using UDP to efficiently send simulation results from server to client.
